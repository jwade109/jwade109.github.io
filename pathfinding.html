      <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">
            A* search algorithm</a> (pronounced "A-star") is a procedure for
        finding the optimal path
        through a weighted graph (that is, a network of edges between nodes
        where the edges have values associated with them). The applications
        are most obvious in pathfinding through a 2-dimensional or 3-
        dimensional space, which is why many robotic systems use A* to
        find their way through their environment.

        It's based on Djikstra's Algorithm, which was developed by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">
            Edsger W. Dijkstra</a> in 1956. The improvement developed
        in A* was the addition of a heuristic function to estimate the
        cost of traversing unvisited nodes, which reduced the number
        of nodes which needed to be visited. Engineers
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_E._Hart">Peter Hart</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Nilsson_(researcher)">
            Nils Nilsson</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertram_Raphael">Bertram Raphael</a>
        published it in 1968 as part of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakey_the_robot">
            Shakey project</a>, which produced a robot with greater
        autonomous capabilities than any before it.

        A* was formerly named A2, and there was an A1 before it.
        A2 was renamed A* because it can be proven to be optimal
        (under certain conditions) and no future version of the algorithm
        can improve upon it; the * represents all future versions.

      <h4>The ideal language, it is held,
        has the following characteristics.</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>It is semantically and syntactically precise.</li>
        <li>It is easy to print, write, read, hear, and dictate.</li>
        <li>It is a potent tool for poets, novelists,
          scientists, and engineers alike.</li>
        <li>It is accessible across cultures and
          age cohorts, and to machines.</li>
        <li>It is expandable, adaptable, fluid.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Limitations placed on Loruun in service to
        these goals are as follows.</p>

      <p>Every letter makes a noise. Words are spelled how they sound,
        no exceptions. There are no homonyms, no homophones, and no
        homographs. One word maps onto exactly one concept, full stop.</p>
      <p>Capitalization is not used. The only non-audible symbols are
        the short pause, which delimits words, and a long pause, which
        delimits sentences. Question marks, quotation marks, exclamation
        points, and other frills are removed. Any important flow control
        structures are conveyed with spoken word. Furthermore inflection,
        cadence, and emphasis are semantically irrelevant.</p>
      <p>A given word can never have more than one role in grammar. For
        example, the ambiguity in English between “house” the noun and
        “house” the verb will never be permitted in Loruun because these
        would be two different words.</p>
      <p>Strict word orderings are only necessary in specific circumstances.
        Not all orderings of words are valid and changing the order of
        words can likely change the meaning of a sentence, but there are
        often many ways to write an equivalent sentence.</p>
      <p>In Loruun, the animated image format is spelled “gif” and
        pronounced with a hard g, because no other g exists. If you want
        a soft g, you’d better spell it with a j.<p>

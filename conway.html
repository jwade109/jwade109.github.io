      <p>The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">
          Game of Life</a>
        is a cellular automaton developed by John Conway in the 1970s.
        It's not really a game, considering there's no way to win, but
        it's a cool demo of how simple rules can be turned into wildly
        complicated emergent behaviors. The Game of Life is determined
        totally by four rules.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live
          neighbors becomes a live cell.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a convention, "live" cells are represented above in black,
        while "dead" cells are represented in white.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fairly simple and notable emergent behavior in the Game of
        Life is called a "glider", which looks like this:
      </p>
      <img width="30%" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block"
        src="resources/glider.png"></img>
      <p>
        If you draw that shape in the grid above (pause the and draw
        black cells with the mouse) you'll see why it's is called a glider.
        There are many, many other emergent behaviors worth noting,
        which you can find
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_
          Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns">here.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to being cool as hell, the Game of Life holds
        a special place in my heart because it was the subject of my
        final project in AP Computer Science. It took me two months
        to figure out how to use Java's graphics library, because it's
        awful and I hate it.

      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Goal:</b> Survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Evasion:</b> Use [SHIFT] to accelerate and dodge incoming
        torpedoes. [A] and [D] will torque your spacecraft left
        and right. Try not to get blown up.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Defense:</b> If you can't dodge a torpedo, don't give up hope
        just yet. You can press [R] to enter "targeting mode" (which
        slows down time to help you aim) and try to shoot down the torpedo
        with your point defense cannons (PDCs). Right clicking the torpedo
        will increase your accuracy. Hurry up, though - you can only spend
        a few seconds in targeting mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Offense:</b> Your main offensive weapon will be torpedoes.
        To fire them, right click on your target and press [SPACE] to fire.
        Each torpedo tube on your vessel will need time to reload, but you
        have an unlimited number of torpedoes to fire.
        You can also fight in close quarters with PDC cannons, but they
        don't do a lot of damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Allies:</b> Every round you'll be greeted by a friendly vessel
        which will tag along with you and help you fight. Don't shoot at
        them! You need as many as you can get, since you can use them as
        meatshields against progressively harder waves of enemies.
        Additionally, they serve as extra lives in the event that you
        are killed; a GAME OVER occurs when you and all friendly vessels
        are destroyed.

      <h2>What is this and why does it exist?</h2>
      <p>
        This is a small game I made. It is <b>heavily</b> inspired by the
          TV show
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)">
          <i>The Expanse</i></a>, which now ranks among the best shows
        I've ever seen. It features some of the best and most grounded
        science fiction space combat in any sci-fi IP. You should go
        watch it, by the way. All of the combat mechanics, vessels,
        and even the title of the game ("The Big Empty" is the title
        of the S1E2) are directly copied from the
        universe of <i>The Expanse</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was also inspired by
        <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1999/gdc99steer.pdf">
          an excellent paper</a> I recently discovered
        on steering behaviors by a magician of a computer scientist named
        <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/">
          Craig Reynolds</a>.
        He's spent his whole glorious career researching ways to simulate
        natural phenomena, especially motion, in a programmatic way.
        All of the AI-driven vessels, both friendlies and unfriendlies,
        use the behaviors laid out in his 1999 paper, which centers around
        the idea of altering a vehicle's trajectory by calculating and
        applying a "steering force".

        If you haven't heard of Coding Train, you're in for a treat.
        It's a YouTube channel run by Daniel Shiffman, the Bob Ross
        of programming. Ultimately he was my inspiration for learning
        about steering behaviors in the first place. Here's
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hA7G3gup-4">
          one of his videos</a>
        on the subject.
      <p>The music is "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1y-bjXOgw"
